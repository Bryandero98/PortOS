/**
 * Drum play-along transport for a SongBook `drum` chart (#3115) — React wrapper
 * over `lib/drumPlayback.js`. Owns the player lifecycle, the practice settings
 * (tempo / count-in / loop range / click on-off and level) and the playback
 * position, so `SongBookViewer` only renders controls.
 *
 * Practice tempo is a PER-MACHINE preference, not synced content: it persists to
 * `safeStorage` under the song id (exactly like the viewer's transpose offset)
 * and is never written into the record. The metronome — both its on/off and its
 * level — is the same kind of preference but global to the MACHINE: the click is
 * a reference pulse you balance against your own playing, not a property of any
 * one song.
 *
 * A timing-critical edit (tempo, count-in, loop range) while playing STOPS
 * playback rather than re-timing a running schedule — already-scheduled audio
 * can't be moved, so a live rebase would desync the position from what you hear.
 * The user presses play again at the new setting. The click toggle, the click
 * level and the kit selection are the exceptions: they gate or scale FUTURE
 * scheduling only, so they apply live.
 *
 * Settings live in state AND are pushed into the player by a sync effect, so the
 * order the seeding effects happen to run in can't leave the player holding a
 * stale tempo (the per-song stored tempo lands after the player is created).
 *
 * POSITION COMES FROM THE AUDIO CLOCK, never from the player's `onStep` event
 * callback — see `resolvePlayhead`. Two consumers, two rates:
 * - `getPlayhead()` is a stable on-demand read for the sheet's own animation
 *   frame loop (a continuous line can't go through React state 8×/second);
 * - `pulse` is the same position quantized to `{ bar, beat, countingIn }` for
 *   the transport's readout, polled per frame but only ever committed to state
 *   when the beat actually turns over — so the whole page re-renders on beats,
 *   not on steps.
 *
 * The player, its interval and its scheduled audio are torn down on stop, on a
 * chart/song change, and on unmount — nothing survives the view.
 *
 * @param {string} text — the raw drum-chart source.
 * @param {{ songId?: string, initialSettings?: object }} [options] — `songId`
 *   keys the persisted tempo; `initialSettings` seeds a second transport that
 *   should inherit the first transport's count-in and loop configuration.
