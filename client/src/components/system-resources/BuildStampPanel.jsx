/**
 * Which code is actually running — the git commit of the server process, and of
 * the bundle this browser loaded (#4694). Why `version` cannot answer this: see
 * the module header of `server/lib/buildIdentity.js`.
 *
 * Fetched from `/api/system/build` rather than read off the health payload: peers
 * scrape `/health/details` and persist it verbatim, so the stamp deliberately
 * does not ride it (see that route's comment).
 *
 * The mismatch banner is the point of the panel — it turns "my change isn't
 * showing up" from a debugging session into a visible fact. The same comparison
 * runs unprompted on every page load (services/socket.js wires the watcher);
 * this is the read-out, not the only detector.
