/**
 * Creative Commission — pure, ability-agnostic directive + cron helpers (#2657).
 *
 * These are side-effect-free helpers: `commissionToCron` turns a schedule
 * descriptor into a 5-field cron string; `renderFeedbackDigest` renders the taste
 * feedback into a steering digest; and `composeDirectiveGoal` folds a list of
 * brief lines + that digest into a CD directive `goal` under MAX_DIRECTIVE_GOAL_LEN.
 * The per-output-type directive assembly (which lines/deliverables each type
 * gets) lives in abilityAdapters.js (#2769), which imports these — this module
 * never imports back. Its only imports are the CAP CONSTANTS the goal budget is
 * derived from (see below); it pulls in no scheduler/store graph, so it stays
 * trivially unit-testable and importable anywhere. The authoritative
 * cron-VALIDITY check (isValidCron) lives in the scheduler/service.
