/**
 * Video render speed profiles (issue #4875).
 *
 * A *speed profile* is a named, pre-validated sampler configuration a user can
 * pick instead of hand-tuning steps and CFG: it swaps the whole schedule at
 * once (stage-1 / stage-2 step counts, guidance, and runtime acceleration
 * levers like TeaCache) for a documented wall-time saving.
 *
 * The relationship between a model and its profiles is DECLARED here — not
 * inferred from a runtime name — and attached to registry entries as
 * `speedProfiles` by `applyVideoSpeedProfiles`, the same load-time backfill
 * pattern `applyVideoDisclosures` (lib/videoDisclosure.js) and
 * `applyVideoFinishProfiles` (lib/videoFinishProfiles.js) use. Migration 295
 * makes it durable on disk for installs that already persisted
 * `data/media-models.json`.
 *
 * ## Why the DEFAULT profile is a first-class entry rather than "absence"
 *
 * `SPEED_PROFILE_DEFAULT_ID` ('quality') is the shipped contract: the exact
 * sampler the model has always rendered with. It exists as a named option so
 * the picker has something to show as selected, but it is deliberately a
 * NO-OP — `resolveVideoSpeedProfile` returns `null` for it, so a quality render
 * builds byte-identical spawn args to a render from before this feature
 * existed, and stamps no extra history fields. Absence and `'quality'` are the
 * same request (`isDefaultSpeedProfile`), exactly as `'stock'` and absence are
 * the same request in lib/videoTextEncoders.js.
 *
 * ## Why compatibility is checked rather than assumed
 *
 * A profile's numbers are validated against ONE pipeline on ONE set of weights.
 * Applying them anywhere else would be a speed claim we cannot back:
 *
 *   - **Weights.** `shippedRepo` + `shippedRevision` must both still match the
 *     entry. A user who re-pointed `repo` at a fork, or moved `revision` off
 *     the pin the schedule was measured against, keeps no profile rather than
 *     inheriting a claim about weights we can no longer vouch for. (The
 *     finish-profile precedent guards `repo` only; a sampler schedule is
 *     revision-sensitive in a way a draft→delivery edge is not, so this guards
 *     both.)
 *   - **Mode.** Only the modes in `profile.modes` route through the pipeline
 *     the schedule was measured on. `fflf`/`extend`/`a2v`/`ic` run entirely
 *     different pipelines (KeyframeInterpolation, Extend, A2Vid, IC-LoRA), so
 *     a profile is DECLINED for them with an explicit reason instead of
 *     silently applying numbers that mean nothing there.
 *   - **Sampler lock.** A `samplerLocked` entry pins its own validated
 *     schedule; a speed profile would be a second authority over the same
 *     dials, so the two are mutually exclusive by construction (asserted by
 *     `validateSpeedProfileTable`).
 *
 * Everything the RUNNER cannot promise ahead of time — is the pinned
 * `ltx_pipelines_mlx` new enough to accept `enable_teacache`? is the distilled
 * adapter actually in the model pack? — is probed by the Python helper at
 * render time, which emits a `SPEEDPROFILE:` line naming what it actually
 * applied. That is what keeps an unavailable lever from becoming a misleading
 * speed claim: the profile still renders (at its step schedule), the missing
 * lever is reported as `degraded`, and the history record says so.
 *
 * Pure module: no I/O, and no imports out to services (the one import is a
 * sibling lib constant).
