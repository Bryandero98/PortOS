/**
 * Build a `cd` command line for the shell a PTY session is actually running.
 *
 * The Shell page's "cd to app" picker used to send a hard-coded POSIX
 * `cd '<path>'` to every session. On Windows that fails twice over, because the
 * default shell is `cmd.exe` (`COMSPEC`):
 *
 *   1. `cmd.exe` has no single-quote quoting — the quotes become part of the
 *      path, so every managed-app folder answered
 *      "The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect."
 *   2. Even correctly quoted, a bare `cd` does NOT switch drives. A session
 *      started in `C:\Users\…` stays there when told to `cd "I:\code\app"`;
 *      `cd /d` is required.
 *
 * So the command is built from the session's real shell binary rather than
 * assumed. Flavors:
 *
 *   • `cmd`        → `cd /d "<path>"`                     (double quotes, /d)
 *   • `powershell` → `Set-Location -LiteralPath '<path>'`  (doubled `'`; crosses
 *                     drives on its own, and -LiteralPath skips glob expansion
 *                     so a `[` in a folder name still resolves)
 *   • `posix`      → `cd '<path>'`                         (shellQuote)
 *
 * A Windows host running a POSIX shell (git-bash `bash.exe`) is detected by the
 * binary name, not the platform, so it keeps POSIX quoting — MSYS translates the
 * Win32 path at the syscall layer.
