/**
 * A control that opens the OS file picker — styled as a button, or as a whole
 * drop zone when you pass drag handlers through.
 *
 * Why this exists instead of a button that reaches into a ref and clicks a
 * hidden input: a *programmatic* click on an `<input type="file">` is a synthetic,
 * untrusted event, and several browsers refuse to open the picker for it —
 * most notably Safari/WebKit when PortOS is running as an installed
 * (`display: standalone`) PWA, which is exactly how it tends to get opened from
 * a remote machine over the tailnet. Activating a `<label for>` is a *native*
 * label activation instead: the browser opens the picker itself, with no
 * reliance on user-activation heuristics, in every engine.
 *
 * The input is visually hidden but stays focusable and exposed to the
 * accessibility tree (it is the labelled control) — do NOT hide a file input
 * with `className="hidden"` (`display: none` drops it from the tab order and
 * the a11y tree) or with `aria-hidden`/`tabIndex={-1}`. The visible label
 * carries the focus ring via `peer-focus-visible:`. `a11yConventions.test.js`
 * enforces this repo-wide.
 *
 * The input's value is cleared after every change — deferred until an async
 * `onChange` settles, since clearing `value` also empties `input.files` — so
 * re-picking the SAME file fires `change` again (otherwise a failed upload
 * can't be retried by re-selecting the same file). Call sites must NOT clear
 * `e.target.value` themselves.
 *
 * Extra props are spread onto the visible `<label>`, and the forwarded ref
 * points at it — that is what lets a drop zone pass `onDrop`/`onDragOver` and
 * still get native picker activation from a click.
 *
 * @param {Object} props
 * @param {(e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => void} props.onChange - change handler; `e.target.files` holds the picked files
 * @param {React.ReactNode} props.children - label content (icon + text)
 * @param {string} [props.accept] - `accept` attribute for the input
 * @param {boolean} [props.multiple] - allow multi-select
 * @param {boolean} [props.disabled] - disable the control
 * @param {string} [props.className] - classes for the visible label
 * @param {string} [props.ariaLabel] - accessible name. Omit it when the visible
 *   text already says enough; supply it to disambiguate a bare "Upload" among
 *   several on one screen. It OVERRIDES the label text, so per WCAG 2.5.3
 *   (Label in Name) it must CONTAIN the visible text — "Upload artist portrait"
 *   for a button reading "Upload" is fine; "Browse files to upload" for one
 *   reading "Browse Files" is not, and strands voice-control users.
 * @param {string} [props.id] - explicit input id (defaults to a generated one)
 * @param {string} [props.name] - input name
