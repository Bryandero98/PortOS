/**
 * "Render here, or on a peer?" — one hook behind every interactive render form
 * that can route a job to a federated media provider (#4348).
 *
 * Three surfaces now ask this question (Music Studio, Image Gen, Video Gen).
 * Each one would otherwise have to fetch the peer list, intersect the local
 * allowlist with the peer's advertised capabilities, and decide for itself what
 * "ready" means — three chances to disagree with the server's own admission
 * check. `resolvePeerMediaReadiness` already collapsed the readiness verdict;
 * this collapses the selection state that feeds it.
 *
 * Deliberately does not poll. A capacity window expires on the clock, not on a
 * state change, so no poll interval makes the button's reading trustworthy at
 * the instant of a click — `verify()` re-derives against the clock at submit
 * time instead, which is the only moment that matters. The server re-probes and
 * fail-closes after that regardless.
