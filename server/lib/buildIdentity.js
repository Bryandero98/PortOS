/**
 * Build identity of the RUNNING install — which git commit this process was
 * started from (#4694).
 *
 * The hazard this closes: one PM2-managed `portos-server` serves :5555 for the
 * whole machine while any number of worktrees (CoS agents, `/do:next` claims,
 * the primary checkout) hold different code. Anyone verifying a change by
 * hitting the running instance is, by default, observing whatever build PM2
 * last started, from whatever checkout, at whatever commit — and nothing in the
 * responses said so. `version` can't answer it: by project rule package.json's
 * version reflects the last RELEASE and is identical across every development
 * commit and every worktree.
 *
 * Distinct from `buildId.js`, which hashes `client/dist/index.html` to detect a
 * browser holding a stale BUNDLE relative to what is on disk right now. That
 * hash says nothing about which commit either side was built from: a `dist/`
 * built three days ago and one built this minute are both "current" to buildId
 * as long as the browser matches the file. This module answers the other half —
 * WHICH CODE is up. The two ride the same `build:id` socket frame precisely
 * because they are complementary halves of one question.
 *
 * Privacy: commit / branch / dirty only. No absolute paths (they embed the OS
 * username), no hostname, no checkout directory — see the Sensitive Data
 * section of the root CLAUDE.md. Deliberately no timestamp either: "how long
 * has this process been up" is already `system.uptime` on the health payload,
 * and a second spelling of it here would drift (uptime is recomputed per
 * request; this tuple is frozen at first read).

// byte-for-byte identically to a real detached HEAD, so the format itself cannot
// separate the two and neither can any parser over it. Reading it as detached is
// the right call anyway: the cost is one mislabeled branch in a display string,
// and `commit` — the field the drift comparison actually uses — is unaffected.
