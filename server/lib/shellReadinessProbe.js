/**
 * Build the round-trip "can this shell actually run commands yet?" probe for
 * the shell a PTY session is actually running (see `createShellSession`'s
 * `waitForPromptReady` in `services/shell.js`).
 *
 * The probe prints a unique nonce and the caller waits to SEE it in the PTY
 * output before injecting the real command — proof the shell is executing,
 * not just echoing keystrokes. The split-literal property is load-bearing and
 * must survive in every dialect: the probe SOURCE must never contain the
 * assembled `PORTOSRDY<nonce>` string, only its two halves as separate
 * literals, so a sighting of the assembled marker in the output can only mean
 * the shell EXECUTED the probe (not merely echoed the command line back).
 *
 * `printf` (POSIX) and `Write-Output` (PowerShell) both support string
 * concatenation from two literals, so both dialects get a real probe.
 * `cmd.exe` has no such operator — `echo` prints its argument line as typed —
 * so there is no way to keep the marker split in `cmd`'s source while still
 * producing it in the output; `null` tells the caller to skip straight to the
 * bounded fallback timer instead of risking an always-matching probe.
