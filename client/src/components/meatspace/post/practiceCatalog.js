/**
 * The enumerable answer to "what can I actually practice in POST?" — the data
 * behind the Practice Library at `/post/explore`.
 *
 * Before this existed, a test type was only discoverable if it happened to be
 * enabled (the launcher's sidebar lists ONLY enabled drills), if the user opened
 * Drill Config, or if they already knew a URL: the Rhetoric trainer had no link
 * anywhere in the app, and the standalone Wordplay/Morse/Elements modes were
 * reachable only from inside their own tabs.
 *
 * EVERYTHING here is derived, never re-typed: topic groups come from
 * `POST_TOPICS` (server-owned, mirrored into `constants.js`), and the surfaces
 * that aren't POST drill types come from each trainer's own exported mode list.
 * That is the point — a page whose job is "nothing is undiscoverable" must not
 * be the one place that has to be remembered when a mode is added.
 *
 * Data only (no JSX, icons carried as NAMES the way `TOPIC_UI` does), so the
 * coverage tests read like data assertions rather than render assertions.
