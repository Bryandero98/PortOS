/**
 * TRELLIS.2 (local Apple Silicon / MPS) target — install detection, pure command
 * builders, a robust progress parser, and a guarded generate runner.
 *
 * Phase 2a of #2951/#2952: the *scaffolding* the install SSE route and the 3D page
 * will drive. Everything here is either pure (path/arg/step builders, the progress
 * parser) or exercised only through injectable dependencies (`exists`, `spawnImpl`)
 * so the wiring is unit-testable **without** downloading the ~15 GB model or running
 * a live GPU render. `runTrellis2Generate` is the one real-subprocess boundary and
 * NEVER auto-runs — it throws unless the model is installed and is only reached from
 * an explicit user action (CLAUDE.md no-cold-bootstrap policy). The exact wording of
 * `generate.py`'s progress output is refined during hands-on validation, so the
 * parser keys on format-agnostic signals (a percentage, a `.glb` path) rather than
 * guessing internal stage names.
 *
 * Install layout mirrors the FLUX.2 venv convention in `pythonSetup.js`
 * (`~/.portos/...`): the `trellis-mac` repo is cloned to `~/.portos/trellis2` and its
 * `setup.sh` builds a `.venv` inside it.

 * bake on — compiles against Eigen, which `trellis2-apple` carries as a git submodule
 * (`o-voxel/third_party/eigen`). Upstream's `clone_dep` runs a bare
 * `git clone --depth 1` with no `--recurse-submodules`, so `third_party/eigen` lands as
 * an EMPTY directory and the build dies on `fatal error: 'Eigen/Dense' file not found`.
 * `setup.sh` swallows that (`|| echo`) and still exits 0 — so the install "succeeds"
 * while permanently stuck on the confetti fallback baker of
 * `TRELLIS2_FALLBACK_BAKE_HELP`, and installing Xcode or the Metal Toolchain (what the
 * warning used to tell users to do) could never fix it.
 *
 * PortOS fixes it from outside upstream: `clone_dep`'s guard is a bare
 * `if [ ! -d "$DEPS_DIR/$dir" ]`, so a directory we cloned ourselves makes upstream skip
 * its own clone, and its unconditional `o-voxel` install then succeeds on the first
 * pass — no need to duplicate upstream's uv / `--no-build-isolation` flags here.
 *
 * Two shapes, because a repair has to fix an install that is already on disk:
 *  - **absent** → clone it, submodules and all.
 *  - **already cloned** by an older `setup.sh`, so Eigen is missing → initialize the
 *    submodules in place. `setup.sh` re-runs the `o-voxel` install unconditionally, so
 *    the rebuild follows in the same pass.
 *
 * **"Already cloned" needs `o-voxel/` present, not just `.git`.** A clone killed
 * partway (SIGKILL, power loss) can leave `.git` behind with no worktree. Keying only
 * on `.git` would then pick the update branch, whose `git submodule update` cannot
 * restore a missing superproject worktree — it would succeed as a no-op, upstream's
 * `! -d` guard would skip its own clone, and `pip install deps/trellis2-apple/o-voxel`
 * would fail on a path that does not exist: silent, permanent degradation, the exact
 * failure this step exists to remove. Requiring the directory upstream actually
 * installs from routes that state to the clone branch instead, which fails loudly on
 * the non-empty target and names the real problem in the log. It does not self-heal
 * (that needs a re-clone, so it is deliberately left to the operator) but it never
 * again reports success while leaving `o_voxel` unbuildable.
 *
 * `optional` for the same reason the toolchain step is: a host that cannot reach
 * gitlab.com for Eigen must still be able to install and render, degraded, rather than
 * fail the whole install.

 * only. `spawnImpl` injectable so the step sequencing / cancel / failure paths are
 * unit-testable without a real 15 GB install.
 *
 * **Transient-failure retry.** A multi-GB install over `setup.sh`'s ~half-dozen git
 * clones routinely eats a mid-transfer `Connection reset` / `early EOF` (#2952) that
 * exits git 128. Both steps are *idempotent* — git removes a failed clone's target

 * skip already-cloned deps and resume from the one that dropped — so a step whose
 * output matches a transient-network signature is retried in place up to `maxRetries`
 * times with a short backoff, rather than aborting the whole install on one blip.

 *
 * **Metal Toolchain step.** `setup.sh` compiles the Metal texture-baking packages
 * from `.metal` sources, so when `installMetalToolchain` is set the install downloads
 * the toolchain FIRST (#3041). Verified on-device: that download runs unattended (no
 * sudo, no prompt), which is what makes auto-install viable instead of printing a
 * command for the user to run. The step is `optional` — see
 * `TRELLIS2_METAL_TOOLCHAIN_STEP`. The caller resolves the flag from
 * `probeMetalToolchain()` (the route does, so this stays synchronous).
 *
 * **Post-install verification.** After the last step the install probes whether the
 * Metal texture-baking backends actually built (`probeBake`, injectable) and emits a
 * `verify` log frame before the terminal `complete`. This is load-bearing, not
 * cosmetic: `setup.sh` installs those packages with `|| echo "… continuing without …"`
