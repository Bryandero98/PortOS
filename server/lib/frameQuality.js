/**
 * Frame-quality scoring — picks the video continuation anchor by measuring
 * candidate frames instead of trusting wherever an end-seek happens to land.
 *
 * A chained render conditions chunk N+1 on ONE frame taken from the tail of
 * chunk N. Local video output is motion-heavy by construction (the prompt
 * guidance explicitly asks for a camera move and a visible action), so that
 * frame is frequently motion-blurred, mid-blink, or inside a fade — and the
 * next chunk inherits the blur as the scene's actual content, compounding
 * through every subsequent hop.
 *
 * The scoring is deliberately cheap and dependency-free beyond `sharp` (already
 * a server dependency): decode each candidate to a raw single-channel buffer,
 * then combine three terms.
 *
 *   focus     — log-compressed variance of the first-difference gradient.
 *               Log compression is what keeps one exceptionally sharp frame
 *               from swamping the exposure term.
 *   exposure  — penalty on the distance of mean luma from mid-grey, which is
 *               what rejects a frame inside a fade-to-black or a blown highlight.
 *   recency   — a small linear preference for later frames, so among
 *               comparably clean candidates the anchor stays as close to the
 *               cut as possible. Without it the scorer drifts toward the calm
 *               middle of the window and continuity loosens.
 *
 * Usability is a SEPARATE question from ranking. `usable` gates on raw gradient
 * variance alone, so only a mathematically degenerate frame (a solid fill, a
 * fully faded one) is rejected outright and a dark-but-real low-key tail still
 * qualifies. Exposure shapes the RANKING, not the gate.

// the scorer routinely anchor further from the cut than the old behavior did —
// widening the backward jump at every chain seam instead of tightening it. The
