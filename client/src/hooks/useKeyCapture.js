// keydowns must still arrive (the Morse keyer `preventDefault`s every tick of a
// held Space, or the page scrolls under it), and so must ⌘/Ctrl/Alt chords
// (dropping a chorded keydown strands it with no matching keyup). The dialog
// guard stays a caller option; the editable-target and button-activation guards
// have no opt-out at all.

/**
 * Capture-phase keyboard listener whose handlers *claim* an event by returning
 * true. A claimed event is `preventDefault`ed and `stopImmediatePropagation`ed,
 * so no app-global bubble-phase handler ever sees it — notably the voice
 * widget's push-to-talk hotkey, which defaults to `Space` and would otherwise
 * open the mic every time the user hits Space on a Space-driven surface.
 * Un-claimed events pass through untouched, so this never becomes a blanket
 * keyboard trap.
 *
 * Which events are offered to the handlers is decided by the shared
 * `shouldIgnoreGlobalKey` predicate (lib/a11yKeyboard.js), also used by
 * `useKeyboardShortcuts` so the two hooks can't drift apart:
 *
 * - Events originating in an editable field are never offered, so a Space-driven
 *   surface that also has a text input keeps normal typing.
 * - **Space on a focused button is never offered**, so the browser's native
 *   activation still happens. A claiming surface almost always renders its own
 *   buttons (a drill's Start/Match, RapidReader's transport, the keyer's mode
 *   switches); without this, tabbing to one and pressing Space ran the claimed
 *   action instead of pressing the button — the exact stand-down the voice
 *   widget and `useKeyboardShortcuts` already performed (#4748).
 * - Nor are events fired while an `aria-modal` dialog is open: the surface is
 *   behind that dialog, and claiming Escape there would dismiss the surface
 *   instead of the layer the user is actually looking at. A surface that itself
 *   lives INSIDE a dialog passes `enabledInDialog: true` to opt back in. Both the
 *   option name and its default mirror `useKeyboardShortcuts`.
 *
 * Handlers are read through refs, so inline arrows recreated every render (the
 * common call-site shape) don't tear down and re-add the listeners; only
 * `enabled` flips the subscription. A handler that is absent entirely doesn't
 * subscribe its listener at all.
 *
 * @param {object}   opts
 * @param {boolean}  [opts.enabled=true]           attach while truthy
 * @param {boolean}  [opts.enabledInDialog=false]  also fire while a dialog is open
 * @param {(e: KeyboardEvent) => boolean} [opts.onKeyDown] return true to claim
 * @param {(e: KeyboardEvent) => boolean} [opts.onKeyUp]   return true to claim
