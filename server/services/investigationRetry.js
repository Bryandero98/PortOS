/**
 * Investigation retry — put a failure-blocked task back in the queue as soon as
 * the investigation that diagnosed it finishes.
 *
 * The failure loop used to be open at both ends. #3714 closed the first half:
 * an agent failure files an investigation task that runs UNATTENDED, so nobody
 * has to approve the diagnosis. But the original task stayed `blocked` forever
 * after the fix landed — the only ways out were a human unblocking it by hand or
 * the 14-day reaper quietly auto-expiring it as stale. So the fix shipped and
 * the work it unblocked never ran.
 *
 * This module closes the second half: when an investigation task completes, the
 * tasks it named in `metadata.affectedTasks` are revived automatically. Bounded
 * by `MAX_AUTO_RETRIES_PER_TASK` so an unresolvable cause can't spin
 * investigate → retry → fail → investigate forever — past the budget the task
 * stays blocked, saying so, and the next same-cause investigation trips the
 * `repeat-fingerprint` hold, which IS the point where a human is the right
 * answer.
 *
 * Imports `cosTaskStore` directly rather than the `cos.js` facade: `cos.js`
 * subscribes to this module's entry point, so going back through the facade
 * would close a load-time cycle.
