/**
 * What a standing unattended render route IS, and whether one may be SAVED.
 *
 * `defaultRouting.js` owns the other half — resolving a saved route at enqueue
 * time, where it re-runs the full capacity preflight and fails closed. This
 * module owns the route's shape and the durable configuration policy, so the
 * settings route can refuse a bad route where the user is standing rather than
 * only where the job is.
 *
 * The distinction matters because the two failures look nothing alike. A route
 * naming a peer that is unknown, switched off, not enabled as a media provider,
 * not allowlisted for that exact model, or reachable outside the tailnet cannot
 * EVER run — it is not a transient capacity problem, it is a configuration that
 * has no working state. Saved unchecked, it persisted silently and then failed
 * every future Creative Director / Creative Commission render, one job at a
 * time, with nobody watching, because unattended work has no human at the
 * moment of failure. That is the "fail closed, never fail quiet" rule of #4679
 * applied one step earlier: refuse it at the save, where there IS a human.
 *
 * Only DURABLE configuration is checked here — never live capacity. A provider
 * peer is routinely asleep, busy, or mid-probe when its route is configured, so
 * gating the save on a fresh snapshot would make the feature unusable at
 * exactly the moment a user sits down to set it up. Freshness, queue admission,
 * and per-model readiness stay on the enqueue path, which re-checks all of them
 * (`assertFederatedMediaProviderSelection`) and re-checks the tailnet gate again
 * per request, since a peer's host can be edited after the route is saved.
 *
 * Clearing a route is ALWAYS allowed. A route saved before its peer changed
 * must stay removable, or a bad configuration becomes permanent.
