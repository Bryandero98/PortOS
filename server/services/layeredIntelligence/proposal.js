/**
 * Validate + normalize the reasoner's JSON. Returns
 * `{ analysis, proposal, pause, invalidFields }` with invalid pieces dropped
 * (never throws):
 *   - `analysis` kept only when it is a string.
 *   - `proposal` kept only when it has a recognized scope + a normalizable slug
 *     + a non-empty title. `slug` is normalized in place.
 *   - `pause` kept only when it has a reason AND a resolvable target: an integer
 *     issue number, or `"this"` WITH a surviving proposal to block on. A
 *     `pause.blockOnIssue: "this"` with a null proposal is invalid → dropped.
 *
 * `invalidFields` (#4166) names every envelope key that was SUPPLIED (present and
 * non-null) but could not be used — the sentinel that separates "the reasoner
 * emitted the wrong shape" from "the reasoner had nothing to say". Dropping is
 * still lenient (callers that only want the usable pieces can ignore it), but a
 * caller deciding whether a run was malformed must not have to re-derive per-field
 * validity: `{"analysis": 7}` reads as a legitimate empty answer without this.
 * `null`/`undefined` is ABSENT, not wrong-typed — an explicit `proposal: null` is
 * the documented "nothing to propose" answer and never lands here. Deliberately
 * ONLY `null`: the prompt documents `null` for "not proposing"/"not pausing", so a
 * model emitting `false` or `"none"` instead is a wrong-typed field and is reported
 * (this already matched the pre-#4166 treatment of a `false` proposal).
