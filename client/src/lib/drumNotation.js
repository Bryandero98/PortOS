// PortOS drum-kit notation — a tiny, dependency-free grid DSL for a drum groove
// and the pure parser that turns it into the structured chart <DrumSheetView>
// draws and drumPlayback.js sounds. Companion to `scoreNotation.js` (pitched
// lead sheets) and `tabNotation.js` (chord/tab sheets): same contract — one pure
// forgiving parser, one hand-rolled SVG renderer, no engraving library.
//
// A drum chart IS a grid, so the format reads like the sheet it renders:
//
//   time: 4/4
//   tempo: 96
//   subdivision: 4        ← grid steps per beat (4 = 16ths, 2 = 8ths, 3 = triplets)
//
//   # Bar 1 — basic rock beat
//   HH: x x x x x x x x
//   S:  - - - - o - - -
//   K:  o - - - - - o -
//
// HEADER lines are `key: value`, in any order, before the music: `time`,
// `tempo`, `subdivision`, and an optional `kit` (a comma/space list of piece
// ids that overrides the row ORDER — never which rows exist). Defaults are
// 4/4, 90 BPM, subdivision 4.
//
// BAR BLOCKS are separated by blank lines. A `#` line is a comment — and
// doubles as the block's label when it's the block's first line. A trailing
// `x2` / `x4` on the label repeats the whole block that many times.
//
// PIECE ROWS are `PIECE: cells`. PIECE is one of the nine kit ids below
// (case-insensitive, long aliases accepted: `crash`, `snare`, `kick`, …).
// CELLS are single characters; whitespace between them is optional and
// ignored, so `xxxxxxxx` and `x x x x x x x x` are the same row.
//
// The parser is forgiving and NEVER throws: an unknown piece token, a bad
// header, or an over-long row collects a message into `errors[]` and the rest
// of the chart still parses. Keep this module pure (no React, no imports) —
// it's unit-tested in a node env and barrelled.

// --- Kit -------------------------------------------------------------------
// One entry per kit piece, in TOP-TO-BOTTOM sheet order (cymbals above drums
// above feet, matching how a drum chart is conventionally engraved). `midi` is
// the General MIDI percussion note (documented reference for anyone wiring a
// MIDI export later — the synth in drumPlayback.js reads `sound`, not `midi`).
// `sound` picks the synth voice; `glyph` picks the notehead shape.
// `technique` is how the piece is struck, in the words a drummer would use at
// the kit — the sheet's tap-a-note readout and legend show it, because a
// hand-rolled notation has no engraving convention to look up. Handedness-
// neutral: which foot works the kick and which side the floor tom sits on depend
// on the kit and the player, so it says what to strike and how, never which limb.
