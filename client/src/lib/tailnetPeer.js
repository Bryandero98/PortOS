/**
 * Is a peer reachable ONLY over the tailnet? — the browser's copy of the gate.
 *
 * A faithful port of `server/lib/tailnetPeer.js`, which stays authoritative:
 * the server refuses a standing route to a non-tailnet peer both when the route
 * is SAVED (`server/services/federatedMedia/routingPolicy.js`) and again on
 * every enqueue, per ADR `docs/decisions/2026-08-20-federated-visual-prompts.md`
 * rule 5. All this copy does is keep a picker from OFFERING a peer the server is
 * about to refuse, which is the difference between an explained absence and a
 * click that fails.
 *
 * It exists as its own module because it previously lived inline in one
 * component, where its CGNAT check quietly skipped the octet-range validation
 * the server does — so `100.64.999.1` read as tailnet in the browser and as
 * public space on the server. A port that diverges is worse than no port; this
 * module's test table is the server's, case for case, so a future edit to
 * either side fails loudly.
 *
 * FAIL-CLOSED: an address this cannot positively recognize as tailnet is
 * treated as NOT tailnet.
