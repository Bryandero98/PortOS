/**
 * The agent-instructions file pair a repository carries (#4852).
 *
 * `AGENTS.md` is the cross-vendor standard every CLI PortOS drives reads —
 * except Claude Code, whose memory discovery hardcodes `CLAUDE.md` with no
 * configurable filename. So a repo needs both, and the second one is a
 * one-line `@AGENTS.md` import rather than a symlink: a git symlink checked out
 * on a Windows runner without symlink support materializes as a 9-byte text
 * file containing the literal string `AGENTS.md`, from which Claude Code loads
 * nothing, and a CLI that reads BOTH names (grok) would ingest the full body
 * twice. A real import file is correct on every platform and inert everywhere
 * else.
