// Shared lookahead-transport for the synth players (#2493). The three players —
// createScorePlayer + createMultiScorePlayer (scorePlayback.js) and
// createMidiPlayer (midiPlayback.js) — all drive a Web Audio OscillatorNode
// graph through the same lookahead-scheduler state machine: a not-yet-running
// context resume with a teardown-race guard, an interval that hands due tones to the
// audio clock, live-node teardown, and pause/stop/finish/seek sequences that
// only differ in WHAT they schedule and WHAT the UI is told. This module owns
// that transport (the clock + node lifecycle); each player supplies the
// scheduling/notify callbacks below and stays a thin scheduler over it, so a fix
// to the token-guard race or teardown semantics lands in exactly one place.
//
// Pure of any player specifics — no React, no score/MIDI concepts. Imports only
// the shared AudioContext; players import createLookaheadTransport from here.

// can't drift apart on feel. Lives here (not in scorePlayback.js) so the

/**
 * Build a lookahead transport that owns the clock and live-node lifecycle for a
 * synth player. The player supplies the pieces that differ between players; the
 * transport owns playing / interval / startTime / offsetSec / nodes / playToken
 * and the play / pause / stop / seek / position transitions.
 *
 * @param {object} hooks
 * @param {() => number} hooks.getTotalSec — current total length in seconds,
 *   re-read every tick and on seek/position (players whose length changes with
 *   tempo return the freshest value).
 * @param {(now:number, startTime:number, track:Function) => void}
 *   hooks.scheduleWindow — one scheduler tick: hand any tones due within
 *   SCHEDULE_AHEAD to the audio clock (via `track(scheduleTone(...))`, `track`
 *   passed in so the player never reaches back into the transport) and fire any
 *   UI/playhead callbacks. Called with the current audio time and startTime.
 * @param {() => boolean} [hooks.prepare] — called in play() AFTER the resume
 *   await + stale-token recheck, BEFORE the transport arms. Rebuild schedules /
 *   create the per-play master bus here. Return false to abort as an empty
 *   schedule (fire onEnded inside); anything else proceeds.
 * @param {(offsetSec:number, soundTails:boolean, startTime:number, track:Function) => void}
 *   [hooks.seekCursors] — position the scheduler/notify cursors at a resume/seek
 *   offset (and, when soundTails, sound notes sustaining across it via `track`).
 *   Called after startTime is set so tails can anchor to the transport clock;
 *   also called with offset 0 by stop/finish to reset the cursors to the top.
 * @param {() => void} [hooks.onStop] — clear-the-playhead notify, fired after the
 *   cursors reset on BOTH stop and natural end (onEnded runs after it on end).
 * @param {() => void} [hooks.onEnded] — natural-end notify, fired once after the
 *   playhead clears when playback reaches the end.
 * @param {() => void} [hooks.onTeardown] — extra teardown after the live nodes
 *   are stopped on pause/stop/finish (e.g. drop the master-bus ref). NOT called
 *   on seek, which reuses the same bus to keep scheduling.
 * @param {string} [hooks.audioSession] — the iOS audio session type to hold
 *   WHILE this transport sounds, released on teardown. Only output-only players
 *   set it, and only to `'playback'`: that is what stops the iPhone's ring/silent
 *   switch from muting a pure-synth page. It is a capability of the player rather
 *   than something the transport assumes, because the session is document-wide
 *   and shared with whatever else is making sound — see the audio-session note in
 *   audioContext.js (a live mic still wins; the arbiter handles that).
 * @returns {{ play, pause, stop, seek, position, isPlaying, track }}
