/**
 * Add OpenRouter's `stealth/ox-alpha` to the shipped OpenRouter provider presets
 * and point their default tier at it.
 *
 * Migration 293 seeded the three OpenRouter records (`openrouter` API +
 * `opencode-openrouter` CLI/TUI wrappers) with only `openrouter/auto`, the
 * gateway's own router. Ox Alpha is a reasoning model aimed at long-horizon
 * agentic coding — 1M context, tool calling, and currently billed at zero on
 * OpenRouter — so it is the model a wrapper should reach for by default, while
 * `openrouter/auto` stays listed as the light tier.
 *
 * A wrapper's model list is otherwise refreshed from the gateway's `/models`
 * endpoint, which needs the sibling API record's key; seeding the id here means
 * an install can select Ox Alpha the moment it pastes a key, with no refresh
 * round-trip first.
 *
 * Conservative in the same way 292 is — see `isUntouchedSeed` below for what
 * that buys and what it deliberately leaves alone.
 *
 * Kept in lockstep with data.reference/providers.json and
 * server/lib/aiToolkit/defaults/providers.sample.json. Later default changes
 * require a new migration.
