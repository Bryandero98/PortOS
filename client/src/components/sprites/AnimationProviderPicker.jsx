/**
 * Which engine renders an animation track's source clip (#4876).
 *
 * Grok's cloud i2v lane was the only option until PortOS grew a local MiniMax H3
 * one, and the two are interchangeable from here down: everything after the MP4
 * — chroma recovery, frame selection, loop trimming, geometry QC, approval,
 * atlas compile — is the same deterministic pipeline. So this is a plain picker
 * shared by the walk panel and every track panel rather than a second workflow.
 *
 * Renders NOTHING until the server's readiness list arrives, and nothing when
 * there is at most one lane: an install with no local build should not carry a
 * one-option dropdown implying a choice it does not have.
 *
 * An unready lane stays visible but disabled, with the server's own `reason`
 * shown as text beside it. That is deliberate — hiding it would leave the user
 * with no way to discover the local lane exists, and per the repo's UI rules a
 * warning that lives only in a `title` is missed on touch.
