/**
 * Normalize a provider command to its comparable binary basename.
 *
 * A toolkit-local twin of `commandBasename` in server/lib/providerModels.js —
 * the vendored toolkit may not import out to sibling PortOS modules (see
 * ../CLAUDE.md), and this rule was previously inlined once per vendor predicate
 * inside `internal/`. One copy inside the boundary is unavoidable; two were not.
 *
 * Strips the directory, lowercases, and drops a Windows `.exe` suffix so a
 * provider configured as `/opt/homebrew/bin/agy`, `AGY`, or `cursor-agent.exe`
 * still matches the bare name. Deliberately does NOT strip `.cmd`/`.bat`: those
 * are npm shim wrappers whose behavior can differ from the native binary, so a
 * predicate that wants them must say so.
 *
 * @param {string|null|undefined} command
 * @returns {string} the normalized basename, or '' for a non-string/empty input
